### Profile
Award winning **Frontend web developer** with an eye for design. I enjoy helping agile teams with UI development based in clean and functional designs, using the latest HTML5, CSS3 and Javascripts standards and web frameworks for static web sites, client-side web apps and large scale CMS sites. Also I am a free/open source software and open web activist with a good experience as speaker, also a D&I (diversity and inclusion) activist with great interest in how technology and especially the web can change the reality of developing countries and different minority groups such as people with disabilities (of which I am a part), ethnic groups and people with low incomes.
